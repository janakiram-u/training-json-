            At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions 
            supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics
             processing unit GPU. Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor 
             instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an 
             instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an
              effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many 
              input or output operations, for example, displaying some text on a computer screen, causing
               state changes that should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in 
               the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction or 
               is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2023, most personal computers, smartphone 
               devices, and servers have processors with multiple execution units, or multiple processors
                performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity 
                than in the past.
